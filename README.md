This is a Roblox fling script that uses a custom GUI to continuously fling selected players. 
You can target multiple players at once, and they will keep getting flung even after respawning â€” 
unless you press the "Stop Fling" button or remove them from the target list.

âœ… Tested and works with JJSploit.
ðŸ”— To run the script, use the following command:

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K1LAS1K/Ultimate-Fling-GUI/main/flingscript.lua"))()

Just copy and paste the above line into your executor (e.g., JJSploit) and the GUI will load.
