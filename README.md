This script allows you to continuously fling selected players using a custom GUI. 
You can select multiple targets at once, and the fling effect will persist even after they die and respawn — 
unless you manually stop it using the "Stop Fling" button or remove the player from the target list. 
It’s designed for consistent and aggressive flinging without needing to re-select players every time.
